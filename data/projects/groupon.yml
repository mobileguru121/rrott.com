about:
  - Groupon is an US e-commerce marketplace. I am working on their notification engine that handles reservation related notifications for Online Booking. It consists of a web server and a set of background workers. The web server exposes endpoints to configure notification profiles and settings as well as callbacks received from the SMS/Calls service.
