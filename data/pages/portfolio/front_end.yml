message: "Before starting coding on Ruby to become a web developer, I worked on various positions in customer support service of a US Cloud Hosting company and all the knowledge and experience I got in tech support allowed me to easily switch into IT department. <br>As a part of the team I was responsible for creating UI that integrates control panel with CloudStack, supporting released features, updating functionality as it was required by MVP and Agile methodologies.<br> I am equally comfortable developing Ruby/Rails backends as working with JavaScript/CoffeeScript in the Front-end. I have experience developing Single Page Applications on Backbone.js and Maronette.js"
