            Hello, my name is <strong>Roman Rott</strong> and I am a <strong>Ruby/JS developer</strong> with 10+ years of IT experience and about 5 years experience dedicated to web development and security auditing of web applications. I consider myself a <strong>Full-Stack developer</strong>, and I am equally comfortable developing Ruby backends as working with JavaScript in the front-end. My technical expertise also includes React, Redux, ES6, a bit of Node,js and some other frameworks/libs. I like testing websites against security vulnerabilities and getting a lot of fun refactoring and optimizing existing apps/libs/sites.
          %p
            In this blog I will cover 2 related spheres: <strong>Web development</strong> and <strong>Security researching</strong>, pin-testing, and everythin around it. I hope it will be useful and probably help people to solve their problems.
