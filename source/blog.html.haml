          Hello, my name is <strong>Roman Rott</strong> and I am a <strong>Ruby/JS developer</strong> with 10+ years of IT experience and about 4 years experience dedicated to web development and security auditing of web applications. I consider myself a <strong>Full-Stack developer</strong>, and I am equally comfortable developing Ruby backends as working with JavaScript in the front-end. My technical expertise also includes CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, a bit of Ember, Node,js and some other frameworks/libs. I like testing websites <strong>against security vulnerabilities</strong> and getting a lot of fun refactoring and optimizing existing apps/libs/sites.
        %p
          Before starting coding on Ruby to become a web developer, I worked on various positions in <strong>Tech Support</strong> department of a US hosting company and all the knowledge and experience I got in tech support allowed me to easily switch into this cool sphere.
        %div
          In this blog I will cover 2 related spheres: <strong>Web development</strong> and <strong>Security researching</strong>, pin-testing, and all about this. I hope it will be useful and help people to solve their issues.
