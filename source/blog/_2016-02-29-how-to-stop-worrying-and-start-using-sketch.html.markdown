# How to stop worrying and start using Sketch =)

> *SVG is an image format for vector graphics. It literally means Scalable Vector Graphics.*
...okay


**Preamble #1:** I am a developer who hates working with such huge graphic editors as Photoshop, GIMP or Illustrator and the problem there is that from one hand I am a perfectionist and love makind perfect websites but from another hand I'm too lazy to spend a lot of time learning tons of information on how to use these image editors =(

**Preamble #2:** I've been using SVG since IE9, and even I had a lot of problem with supporting it, I faced much more problems creating or editing SVG images. The worst moments of my life were when I had to update **"a bit"** an SVG image... Each time I tried to find a really good vector graphic editor but with no success... till I tried **Sketch 3**! 
Honestly, I love it!

When I started working on my website and my blog, I've got an idea about creating a small logo or something to describe who am I and what I do. 

###I leave it up in Ukraine; I love my country; and know what? I've got an idea that is a simple as that: 
>**What if I put Ukrainan emblem into the ruby logo?**

##And after several weeks of painting, I finished with the following result:

At the moment, my less hated editor was Gimp, so I started working with it, but got stack right away... I spent a day for nothing and have got an ugly not-scalable picture that looked like big red blot =(

I knew about Sketch and tried it a year ago, but it was too simple for its prise and I abandoned idea of using it... till now. I gave it a chance once again, and it made my day!

Above is how it looked like:

It's smart and simple, is not it?
