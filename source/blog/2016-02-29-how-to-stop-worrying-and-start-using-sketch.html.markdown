# How to stop worrying and start using Sketch.

> *SVG is an image format for vector graphics. It literally means Scalable Vector Graphics.*
...they say

**Preamble #1:** From my experience, some(if not most of) developers hate working with such huge graphic editors as GIMP, Photoshop or Illustrator, and I am one of such developers. It was really too hard for me to edit images using them: from one hand I am a perfectionist and love working on awesome pictures and interfaces but from another hand I'm too lazy to spend a lot of time in a single tool =)

**Preamble #2:** I've been using SVG since IE9, and even I had a lot of problem with supporting it, I faced much more problems creating or editing SVG images. It was the worst moments of my life when I had to update an SVG image "a bit"... Each time I tried to find any really good vector graphic editor I got nothing but SublimeText. And it was true till I tried **Sketch 3**! And I really suggest using it, I love it and this blog post tells why.

**Preamble #3:** When I started designing my site and blog, I found myself happy with thinking about creating some kind of logo that would show who I am and what I do. I leave it up in Ukraine, I love my country and know what?, I came to the following result:
![Ruby-Logo](https://rrott.com/images/rrott-ruby-logo.svg)

My initial idea was simple as door: **mix Ukrainan emblem with ruby**. When I started working on it, I choose Gimp as it was my favorite editor and previously I used it to paint almost everything I need.
But I had no idea how designers create logos, where they start from, what tools use, etc, etc. And I wanted to do this with as less efforts and as fast as possible. But I even had no idea how to do this slow and with max eforts! =(

I knew about Sketch and tried it at once a year ago, but I did not get it... till now.

Here is a slow-motion of the creation process of my logo's second version.

It's smart and fast, is not it?
