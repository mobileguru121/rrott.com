              Hello, my name is Roman Rott!
            %ul
              I'm an Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 10+ years of IT experience and about 4 years experience dedicated to web-development and security auditing of web applications.
              I specialise in developing secure and optimised websites as well as on testing websites against security vulnerabilityes.
            %ul
              %b CoffeeScript and Ruby
              are my best to follow TDD and OOP best practices.
              I do enjoy building everything from small OSS libs, business sites, Landing Pages to rich interactive web apps.
            %ul
              I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and at odd times I am taking part of bug-bounty programs.
