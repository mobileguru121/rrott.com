            %ul
              Hello, My name is Roman Rott!  I'm an Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 12 years of IT experience. Last 3+ years experience dedicated to web-development and security auditing.
              I like working on Agile-driven projects, and specialise in developing secure and optimised websites.
              %b CoffeeScript and Ruby languages
              are my best to follow TDD and OOP best practices.
            %ul
              I enjoy building everything from small business sites to rich interactive web apps. I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and at odd times I am taking part of bug-bounty programs.

              During last 3 years I was developing, supporting and maintaining web-projects for an US hosting company. The company services the world-wide shared and cloud hosting to its customers. My web developer portfolio is a sample of the projects that I've worked on in the last years.

              At the same time I used to design vulnerable applications for CTF hacking games. Above portfolio consists list of such web services as well.
            %ul
              These sites were developed using Ruby, CoffeeScript, Javascript, Backbone, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, etc. Some of them experience a large amount of traffic on a daily basis.
