      Hello, my name is
      %span Roman Rott!

      %p
        I'm a Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 10+ years of IT experience and about 4 years experience dedicated to web development and security audit of web applications.
        I specialize in developing secure and optimised websites as well as in testing websites for security vulnerabilities.
      %p
        %strong CoffeeScript and Ruby
        are among my favorites when it comes to following TDD and OOP best practices.
        I do enjoy building everything from small OSS libs, business sites, Landing Pages to rich interactive web apps, single page applications.
      %p
        I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and from time to time I take part in bug-bounty programs.

        %p During last 3+ years, I have been developing, supporting and maintaining web-projects for the US hosting company - Ecommerce.com. The company services high-level world-wide shared and cloud hosting products to its customers. There I grew up as a web-developer, as a manager, and as a person.

        %p I also design and develop vulnerable applications for CTF hacking games that give an opportunity for researchers to practice their skills. Below is a portfolio that contains a list of such web services.

        %p All of these sites were developed using Ruby, CoffeeScript, Javascript, Backbone, Sinatra, Padrino, and Ruby on Rails frameworks. Some of them handles large amounts of traffic on daily basis.

        %p My Full-Stack web developer portfolio is a brief summary of the projects samples that I've accomplished in 2015.
