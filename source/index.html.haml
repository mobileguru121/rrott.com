      Hello, my name is
      %span Roman Rott!

      %p
        I'm a Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 10+ years of IT experience and 5+ years experience dedicated to web development and security audit of web applications.
        I specialize in developing secure and optimised websites as well as in testing websites for security vulnerabilities.
      %p
        %strong Ruby
        is my favorites when it comes to following TDD and OOP best practices, while
        %strong JavaScript
        is the best one for front-end and functional programming.
      %p I do enjoy building everything from small OSS libs, business sites, landing pages to rich interactive web apps, single page applications, etc.
      %p
        I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and from time to time I take part in bug-bounty programs.

        %p During the last 5 years, I have been developing, supporting and maintaining web-projects for an US hosting company, consulting and finantial companies. Ecoommerce.com is the hosting company services high-level world-wide shared and cloud hosting products to its customers. There I grew up as a web-developer, as a manager, and as a person. Sphere inc is a consulting company, where I've got extended expirience in React and Redux.

        %p I also design and develop vulnerable applications for CTF hacking games that give an opportunity for researchers to practice their skills. Below is a portfolio that contains a list of such web services.

        %p
          All of these sites were developed using
          %strong
            Ruby, CoffeeScript, JavaScript(EcmaScript), React, Backbone, Sinatra, Padrino, and Ruby on Rails
          frameworks. Some of them handles large amounts of traffic on daily basis.

        %p My Full-Stack web developer portfolio is a brief summary of the projects samples that I've accomplished during last 2 years.
