                I'm a Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 10+ years of IT experience and about 4 years experience dedicated to web development and security auditing of web applications.
                I specialise in developing secure and optimised websites as well as in testing websites for security vulnerabilities.

                are among my favorites when it comes to following TDD and OOP best practices.
                I do enjoy building everything from small OSS libs, business sites, Landing Pages to rich interactive web apps.

                I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and at times I am taking part of bug-bounty programs.

          %p During last 3 years, I have been developing, supporting and maintaining web-projects for the US hosting company - Ecommerce.com. The company services  the high-level of world-wide shared and cloud hosting products to its customers.

          %p I also used to design vulnerable applications for CTF hacking games that give an opportunity for researchers to practice their skills. Bellow portfolio contains a list of such web services.
          %p All of these sites were developed using Ruby, CoffeeScript, Javascript languages and Backbone, Sinatra, Padrino, Ruby on Rails frameworks. Some of them experience a large amount of traffic on daily basis.
          %p My web developer portfolio is a brief summary of the projects samples that I've accomplished in 2015.
